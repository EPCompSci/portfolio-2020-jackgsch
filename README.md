2020-2021 Portfolio

I have learned an immense amount about swift this first term. Starting with no background in swift to now working with a whole team on a large scaleable app. My learned first started with some tutorials on youtube and from Apple's own tutorials. My first app was a google map view of Gale Woods with a picture of myself and some different text fields. 

I furthered my learning by combining learning from different tutorials into my own customized app. My next app was teh customization of a tutorial I followed. I followed the tutorial and made the card game 'war'. I then added some different text fields, modified the looks of the app, and made an app icon for it.

The third step in my learning was to make an entire app from the ground up. No tutorials involved. What I chose to make was a cookie clicker app. Every time you click the cookie your score goes up. I implemented ideas from the card game app, as well as some of the basics from the Gale Woods app too. I finished this app with an app icon and downloaded it on my phone.

I am currently on the fourth and fifth step of my learning where I use what I know, I reasearch what I do not know, and I collaborate with others where all of our skills are utilized. An important part in this was and still is learning how to use GitHub. With some previous exposure in Java it is not a completely foreign idea, but it has taken some time to remember everything about GitHub.

Create links to group projects (create a new repo for completed apps) you've been working on, making sure the read me's have details about what the apps do in the format the app store asks - look at a couple apps to see what I'm talking about. Don't forget about those first simple apps you created - they still matter!

2020-2021 Portfolio

I have learned an immense amount about swift this first term. Starting with no background in swift to now working with a whole team on a large scaleable app. 

I first started by watching some tutorials on youtube and from Apple's own tutorials, I also read from some forums online. My first app was a google map view of Gale Woods with a picture of myself and some different text fields. This is one of Apple's begginer tutorials where I used my own images and different coordinates than the tutorials.

1st App: Gale Woods

I furthered my learning by combining learning from different tutorials into my own customized app. My next app was the customization of a tutorial I followed. I followed the tutorial and made the card game 'war'. I then added some different text fields, modified the looks of the app. A big item I learned was when I made an app icon for it. When downloaded the app would have a cool image.

2nd App: WarCardGame

The third step in my learning was to make an entire app from the ground up. No tutorials involved. What I chose to make was a cookie clicker app. Every time you click the cookie your score goes up. I implemented ideas from the card game app, as well as some of the basics from the Gale Woods app too. I finished this app with an app icon and downloaded it on my phone.

3rd App: ButtonClicker

I am currently on the fourth and fifth step of my learning, where I use what I know and I reasearch what I do not know. I also am collaborating with others and all of our skills are being utilized. An important part in this app was and still is learning how to use GitHub. With some previous exposure in Java in Spring 2019, it is not a completely foreign idea, but it has taken some time to remember everything about GitHub. The app uses an API to connect to Schoology, our schools main online platform for teacher-student connection. Students are able to connect with teachers and see assignments on their phone. More features are outlined and will hopefully be implemented soon!

4th App: EPHS-App

Create links to group projects (create a new repo for completed apps) you've been working on, making sure the read me's have details about what the apps do in the format the app store asks - look at a couple apps to see what I'm talking about. Don't forget about those first simple apps you created - they still matter!

2020-2021 Portfolio 

Since the begining of the year, I have developed a large skill set within Swift. Listed below is a timeline of my projects, with descriptions of my accomplishments, with links to each repository. Enjoy!!

I first started by watching some tutorials on youtube and Apple's own tutorials, I also read some forums online. My first app was a google map view of Gale Woods   with a picture of myself and some different text fields. This is one of Apple's begginer tutorials where I used my own images and different coordinates than the     tutorials.

1st App: https://github.com/jackgsch/GaleWoods/tree/main

I furthered my learning by combining learning from different tutorials into a tutorial I watched. I followed the tutorial and made the card game 'war'. I then  added some different text fields and modified the formating of the app. A big thing I learned was when I made an app icon for it. Using sketch I was able to make an  image for the app on your home screen.

2nd App: https://github.com/jackgsch/WarCardGame1/tree/main

The third step in my learning was to make an entire app from the ground up. No tutorials involved. What I chose to make was a cookie clicker app. Every time you  click the cookie your score goes up. I implemented ideas from the card game app, as well as some of the basics from the Gale Woods app too. I finished this app with  an app icon and downloaded it on my phone.

3rd App: https://github.com/jackgsch/CookieClicker/tree/main

This was the fourh and fifth step of my learning, implementing ideas I know and researching things I do not know. Additionally, this project took place in a team  atmosphere, delegating tasks across the board to everyone. I had a couple different roles in the development and advertising of our app. It started with the  overall outline of our app, deciding different features to include and not to include. Next, I helped develop a foundation for our app, adding different screens and  a menu bar to switch between different pages, like instagram. I also played a big role in the graffics and images in our app, developing our app icon, finding,   modifying, and uploading different icons to be used within the app. Additionally, I bounced around helping different members of our group with their work. Helping  find and resolve bug issues, working a little with the API and helping upload our app to Test Flight. Another big role in this project was the marketing of our app.  I was in charge of the whole class twitter, helping promote not just our app. With this came designing and sharing promotion squares, with teh App Icons and a brief  description. Uploading those to twitter and helping gain publicity.

4th App: https://github.com/connorholm/ephsapp2020

Since then I have been working on learning and using different features within Swift to make games. I learned about game view and how to add sprites in games and how to change gravity and how they interect with other sprites. After following a tutorial on how to make pong, I used my mew skills to help Jose with his CarRacer app. With most of the foundation done, with just a few days I added some new sprites and got them added to the game to add more diversity to the items encountered on the road. Additionally, together we attempted to add a score for each round. Unfortunatly with the limited time, the way the app was made, and trying to get it uploaded to test flight it proved too difficult to add without significantly more research. 

5th App: https://github.com/jmblanco22/CarRacer/tree/main/CarRacer.xcodeproj

Overall I have learned a lot about Swift, starting with nothing and now being able to work collaborativly with others is super fun. Taking on a whole new language has been an exciting experience and I hope to keep adding to my list of languages soon, possibly with python next :)
